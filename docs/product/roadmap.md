# Pika Roadmap

> Versioned milestones for Pika development

---

## Version Philosophy

**v1: Schema** — Rock-solid schema enforcement, inheritance model, type safety
**v2: PKM** — Plugins, ecosystem, dashboards, visibility into your knowledge
**v3: AI** — Built-in AI features, ingest, automation

---

## v1.0: Schema (Current Focus)

The core promise: your notes can't violate the schema.

### Execution Order

Work should proceed in this order due to dependencies:

#### Phase 1: The Big Rename + Refactor

| P0 | `ovault-zg8` | Rename ovault to pika | — |
| P0 | `ovault-wbz` | Implement inheritance model | `ovault-zg8` |

#### Phase 2: Core Inheritance Features
After inheritance model is in place:
| Priority | Issue | Title |
|----------|-------|-------|
| P1 | `ovault-9g9` | Implement ownership and folder computation |
| P1 | `ovault-0k0` | Update tests for new schema format |
| P1 | `ovault-taz` | Implement context field validation |
| P1 | `ovault-ita` | Implement recursive type support |
| P1 | `ovault-oa8` | Update audit for new type resolution |

#### Phase 3: Schema Management CLI
| Priority | Issue | Title |
|----------|-------|-------|
| P1 | `ovault-tsh` | Schema Management CLI |
| P2 | `ovault-w2a` | `pika schema add-type` command |

| P2 | `ovault-3nd` | Schema migration system |
| P2 | `ovault-fkd` | Finalize command surface |
| P2 | `ovault-oay` | Template spawning with ownership |
| P2 | `ovault-xy1` | Remove name_field, standardize on 'name' |

### v1.0 Exit Criteria
