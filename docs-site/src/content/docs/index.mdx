## What is Bowerbird?

Bowerbird is a CLI tool that enforces strict schemas on Markdown/YAML files. It brings TypeScript-style type safety to personal knowledge management—your notes can't violate the schema, your queries always return valid data, and migrations are explicit.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Create a new task with schema-driven prompts
bwrb new task

# List all tasks filtered by status
bwrb list task --where "status = 'active'"

# Audit your vault for schema violations
bwrb audit
```
